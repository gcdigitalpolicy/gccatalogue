# Accessibility Statement

Accessibility statements are a way for Government of Canada organizations to describe how they're working to meet accessibility requirements, and what work still needs to be completed.

## Advantages

Accessibility statements make it easier for persons with disabilities to understand:

- How they can best use a website or mobile application
- Whether or not a website or mobile application is 'fully', 'partially,' or 'not' compliant with accessibility standards
- How they can get alternatives to content that is not accessible to them
- Who to contact to report an accessibility issue or ask for help
